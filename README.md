# Hi there 👋, I’m Debalina   

💻 **About Me**  
I’m a data science enthusiast with a background in **engineering, data analysis, and backend development**. My passion lies in **learning a little bit more** everyday, about the power of data. I love uncovering insights from data and building **machine learning models** that solve real-world problems.  
🌱 While I took a career break for family, it did not stop my quest for learning! Valuable certifications and hands-on helped me stay on track in my learning journey with data! 

🔍 **What I Do**  
- Analyze and visualize data using **Python, R, SQL, Tableau, scikit-learn, matplotlib**  
- Build predictive models with **Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks**  
- Work on **end-to-end projects** from data cleaning, EDA to model deployment  
- Share knowledge and grow through collaborative projects and Kaggle challenges
